X Events should be able to have multiple speakers and abstracts (lightning round, code camp?)
X Should be able to set a max registration for an event, whether registration is open or closed, etc.
X Users should be able to register for accounts
X User profile includes full name, username, password, location, company, email, website, blog feed, twitter feed, facebook (?), etc.
X Account registration should be moderated (i.e. to ensure that folks are actually likely to participate...similar to Google Groups, prevent spam)
X Users can have their accounts "upgraded" to speaker, which will allow them to register availability for meetings, upload slides and other resources, etc.
- Add the ability to upload files for a topic
X Registered members should be able to register for meetings
